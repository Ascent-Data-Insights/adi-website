# Welcome to Ascent Data Insights

We're excited to introduce Ascent Data Insights, a Cincinnati-based consultancy dedicated to helping startups and mid-size companies harness the power of data and AI.

## Our Story

Ascent was founded by two data scientists who spent years working at 84.51°, one of the country's leading analytics companies. We saw firsthand what great data strategy, AI implementation, and engineering can do at scale. We started Ascent to bring that same level of rigor and quality to businesses in the Greater Cincinnati region.

## What We Do

We focus on three core areas:

### 1. Data Modernization

Great data strategy isn't just about collecting information—it's about making that information work for you. We help you build a modern data foundation that takes you from raw data to real decisions.

### 2. AI Strategy & Implementation

We've been in AI for years, and we know the difference between a breakthrough and a buzzword. Our job is to be honest with you: if AI isn't the right fit, we'll tell you. If it is, we'll build it right.

### 3. Innovation Engineering

Got a product idea, an internal tool, or a prototype that doesn't exist yet? We're tech-stack agnostic problem solvers who love building from scratch.

## Our Approach

We don't just build infrastructure and hand over the keys. We make sure your team understands what we've built, so you're not dependent on us forever. You're empowered.

**You know your business. We know data, AI, and software. Together, we create solutions that stick.**

## Why We Started Ascent

We started Ascent because we believe growing businesses deserve the same quality of data and AI expertise that big enterprises get—without the big enterprise price tag or attitude.

We're not here to sell you something you don't need. We're here to listen, understand your problem, and build the right solution.

## Get in Touch

We'd love to hear what you're working on. Whether you're dealing with messy data, curious about AI, or need to build something from scratch—let's talk.
