# AI Hype vs. Reality: What Actually Works

If you've been paying attention to tech news lately, you'd think AI is about to solve every business problem imaginable. The reality? It's more nuanced than that.

We've spent years building and deploying AI systems—from predictive models to natural language processing to computer vision. Here's what we've learned about where AI creates genuine value and where it's just hype.

## Where AI Actually Works

### 1. Automating Repetitive Tasks

**The Reality:** AI excels at taking repetitive, rule-based tasks and making them faster and more consistent.

**Good Use Cases:**
- Document classification and routing
- Data entry and validation
- Quality control inspection
- Fraud detection

**Why It Works:** These problems have clear inputs, clear outputs, and lots of training data. The ROI is easy to measure.

### 2. Pattern Recognition at Scale

**The Reality:** AI can spot patterns in large datasets that humans would miss—or take too long to find.

**Good Use Cases:**
- Predictive maintenance (spotting equipment failure patterns)
- Customer churn prediction
- Demand forecasting
- Anomaly detection

**Why It Works:** You have historical data, the patterns are complex, and the predictions drive real decisions.

### 3. Personalization and Recommendations

**The Reality:** AI can tailor experiences to individual users based on behavior and preferences.

**Good Use Cases:**
- Product recommendations
- Content personalization
- Dynamic pricing
- Targeted marketing

**Why It Works:** You have user data, the business model rewards personalization, and you can measure impact.

## Where AI Usually Doesn't Work

### 1. Problems Without Data

**The Problem:** You can't build a good AI system without good training data. Period.

If you don't have:
- Enough examples (usually thousands at minimum)
- Labeled or structured data
- Representative data that matches your use case

...then AI probably isn't the right solution yet. Focus on data collection first.

### 2. Problems That Need Human Judgment

**The Problem:** AI is great at optimization, but terrible at wisdom.

If your problem requires:
- Ethical judgment
- Creative problem-solving
- Strategic thinking
- Empathy and emotional intelligence

...then AI should augment humans, not replace them.

### 3. One-Off Problems

**The Problem:** Building and maintaining AI systems takes time and resources.

If you're solving a problem that:
- Only happens occasionally
- Changes constantly
- Doesn't have enough volume to justify the investment

...then a simpler solution (or just doing it manually) is probably better.

## Our Honest Assessment Framework

Before we recommend AI to a client, we ask:

1. **Do you have the data?** Not just some data—the *right* data in sufficient quantity.
2. **Is it repeatable?** Does this problem happen often enough to justify building an AI solution?
3. **Can you measure success?** Do you know what "good" looks like and can you track it?
4. **Is simpler not better?** Could a spreadsheet, a script, or a basic rule-based system work just as well?
5. **Do you have buy-in?** Will people actually use this, or will it sit unused?

If the answer to any of these is "no," AI might not be the right move.

## The Bottom Line

AI is a powerful tool—but it's not magic. It works best when:
- You have clear, repetitive problems
- You have good data
- You can measure impact
- You're willing to iterate and improve

It's worst when:
- You're chasing hype instead of solving real problems
- You expect it to work perfectly out of the box
- You ignore the data quality and infrastructure work required

We've turned down AI projects because we didn't think they'd deliver value. That's the kind of honesty growing businesses need.
